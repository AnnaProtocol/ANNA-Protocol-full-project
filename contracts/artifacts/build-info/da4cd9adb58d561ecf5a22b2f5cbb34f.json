This address can then be used for verification purposes.\n The `ecrecover` EVM precompile allows for malleable (non-unique) signatures:\n this function rejects them by requiring the `s` value to be in the lower\n half order, and the `v` value to be either 27 or 28.\n IMPORTANT: `hash` _must_ be the result of a hash operation for the\n verification to be secure: it is possible to craft signatures that\n recover to arbitrary addresses for non-hashed data. A safe way to ensure\n this is by receiving a hash of the original message (which may otherwise\n be too long), and then calling {MessageHashUtils-toEthSignedMessageHash} on it."},"id":3069,"implemented":true,"kind":"function","modifiers":[],"name":"recover","nameLocation":"3723:7:10","nodeType":"FunctionDefinition","parameters":{"id":3045,"nodeType":"ParameterList","parameters":[{"constant":false,"id":3042,"mutability":"mutable","name":"hash","nameLocation":"3739:4:10","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":3069,"src":"3731:12:10","stateVariable":false,"storageLocation":"default","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_bytes32","typeString":"bytes32"},"typeName":{"id":3041,"name":"bytes32","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"3731:7:10","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_bytes32","typeString":"bytes32"}},"visibility":"internal"},{"constant":false,"id":3044,"mutability":"mutable","name":"signature","nameLocation":"3758:9:10","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":3069,"src":"3745:22:10","stateVariable":false,"storageLocation":"memory","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_bytes_memory_ptr","typeString":"bytes"},"typeName":{"id":3043,"name":"bytes","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"3745:5:10","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_bytes_storage_ptr","typeString":"bytes"}},"visibility":"internal"}],"src":"3730:38:10"},"returnParameters":{"id":3048,"nodeType":"ParameterList","parameters":[{"constant":false,"id":3047,"mutability":"mutable","name":"","nameLocation":"-1:-1:-1","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":3069,"src":"3792:7:10","stateVariable":false,"storageLocation":"default","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"},"typeName":{"id":3046,"name":"address","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"3792:7:10","stateMutability":"nonpayable","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"}},"visibility":"internal"}],"src":"3791:9:10"},"scope":3313,"src":"3714:255:10","stateMutability":"pure","virtual":false,"visibility":"internal"},{"body":{"id":3118,"nodeType":"Block","src":"4348:342:10","statements":[{"id":3117,"nodeType":"UncheckedBlock","src":"4358:326:10","statements":[{"assignments":[3087],"declarations":[{"constant":false,"id":3087,"mutability":"mutable","name":"s","nameLocation":"4390:1:10","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":3117,"src":"4382:9:10","stateVariable":false,"storageLocation":"default","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_bytes32","typeString":"bytes32"},"typeName":{"id":3086,"name":"bytes32","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"4382:7:10","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_bytes32","typeString":"bytes32"}},"visibility":"internal"}],"id":3094,"initialValue":{"commonType":{"typeIdentifier":"t_bytes32","typeString":"bytes32"},"id":3093,"isConstant":false,"isLValue":false,"isPure":false,"lValueRequested":false,"leftExpression":{"id":3088,"name":"vs","nodeType":"Identifier","overloadedDeclarations":[],"referencedDeclaration":3076,"src":"4394:2:10","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_bytes32","typeString":"bytes32"}},"nodeType":"BinaryOperation","operator":"&","rightExpression":{"arguments":[{"hexValue":"307837666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666","id":3091,"isConstant":false,"isLValue":false,"isPure":true,"kind":"number","lValueRequested":false,"nodeType":"Literal","src":"4407:66:10","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_rational_57896044618658097711785492504343953926634992332820282019728792003956564819967_by_1","typeString":"int_const

@dev Calculate the modular multiplicative inverse of a number in Z/nZ.\n If n is a prime, then Z/nZ is a field. In that case all elements are inversible, except 0.\n If n is not a prime, then Z/nZ is not a field, and some elements might not be inversible.\n If the input value is not inversible, 0 is returned.\n NOTE: If you know for sure that n is (big) a prime, it may be cheaper to use Fermat's little theorem and get the\n inverse using `Math.modExp(a, n - 2, n)`.
